## Installation

Download this repository as a zip by
clicking [this](https://github.com/OguzhanUmutlu/lively-gradient/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

Go to
`C:\Users\HP\AppData\Local\Packages\12030rocksdanister.LivelyWallpaper_97hta09mmv6hy\LocalCache\Local\Lively Wallpaper\Library\wallpapers`
in your file explorer.

Make a new folder and name it anything you want. Extract the **contents** of the zip file into it.

To make sure you did everything right, you can check that the folder you created should have a `LivelyInfo.json` in it.

Restart if Lively is running, unless run it.

Now you can click the `Motion Gradient` wallpaper and viola, you are done!
